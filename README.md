Working prototypes of improved GO Transit departure screens.

These are inspired by Justin "Taylor" Fan's and Metrolinx's concept art, which you can read more about in this blogTO article: https://www.blogto.com/city/2021/12/student-creates-go-transit-schedule-signs-toronto-union-station/

When finished, the program will use Union Station departures data from the GO Transit API and scrolling public messages from the gotracker.ca API.

This is currently a work in progress, and more will come.
